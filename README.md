# CTG Games Archive

An archive of some simple mobile and web games I built long ago.

## iOS - Lua - Codea
Most of the games in this repo are mobile games written in Lua for Codea (https://codea.io)

Some of these are available on the app store, others are not. 

## Web - Processing
Some are also available as slightly different web games at (https://tarrouye.net/games).
For these, I will usually also provide the .pde Processing file since the codebases are separate. 

## Attribution
You may use the code within this repository in your own projects but please provide attribution.
